[20 bytes (blob header)]
[4] magic bytes 'XABA'
[4] version 1 (0x00000001)
[4] LocalEntryCount (assemblies count)
[4] GlobalEntryCount (same shit i don't know)
[4] StoreId (if its zero then we need to read the hash entries)

[24 bytes x LocalEntryCount (assembly header)]
[4] DataOffset (offset of first byte of 'XALZ' magic bytes)
[4] DataSize (number of bytes of the assembly)
[4] DebugDataOffset (idk)
[4] DebugDataSize (idk)
[4] ConfigDataOffset (idk)
[4] ConfigDataSize (idk)

[20 bytes x GlobalEntryCount (32 bit hash entry)]
[8] 32 bit hash (4 bytes padded zeroes are added)
[4] MappingIndex (looks the same as LocalStoreIndex)
[4] LocalStoreIndex (index of the assembly)
[4] StoreID (idk)

[20 bytes x GlobalEntryCount (64 bit hash entry)]
[8] 64 bit hash
[4] MappingIndex (looks the same as LocalStoreIndex)
[4] LocalStoreIndex (index of the assembly)
[4] StoreID (idk)

[assembly binary - important lz4 version 1.1.11 (in c#) 1.1.0 (in python)]
[4] magic bytes 'XALZ'
[4] descriptor index (ignore)
[4] decompressed length
[rest of the bytes is the block that needs to be decompress]
